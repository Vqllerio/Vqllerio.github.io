# Python Basics

Python, in my experience, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that’s super versatile. I’ve found it really beginner-friendly because of its simple and clean syntax—it’s easy to pick up and understand, even if you’re new to programming.

One thing I like about Python is that it’s dynamically typed, so I don’t have to worry about declaring variable types—it just figures it out as the program runs. Plus, it’s interpreted, meaning it executes code line by line, which has been great for debugging and testing ideas quickly.

What makes Python stand out to me is how versatile it is. You can use it on pretty much any platform—Windows, macOS, Linux—and it’s widely used in so many areas. For example, I’ve seen it used in web development, data analysis, AI/ML, and even for automating repetitive tasks.

Another thing I’ve really appreciated is the massive library ecosystem. Whether it’s NumPy and pandas for data analysis or Django and Flask for web development, there’s probably a library or framework for whatever you want to do. And the Python community? Honestly, it’s one of the best—there are so many tutorials, forums, and resources out there to help you get unstuck.

For me, Python has become my go-to for projects because it strikes a great balance between being simple enough for quick scripts but powerful enough for complex applications. Have you ever tried using Python for something specific?

# If Statements

`if` statements are used to perform a specific action when a certain condition is met.

### Example:

```python
ayam = 2

if ayam == 1:
    print("You have less than 2 chickens")
elif ayam == 2:
    print("You have exactly 2 chickens")
else:
    print("You have more than 2 chickens")
