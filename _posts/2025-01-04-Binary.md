Binary is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is the foundation of computing and digital electronics because digital systems, like computers, store and process data using binary numbers.

### Why do computers use binary?
Binary is used in computers because it's simple, reliable, and efficient. The on/off states of binary match the physical behavior of electronic components, like transistors, that power computers, allowing them to process data quickly and accurately. This simplicity also makes it easy to design logical operations, store data, and perform complex calculations while maintaining low power consumption and minimizing errors. Computers use logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) to process information, and these gates operate on binary data (0s and 1s). Boolean algebra, which forms the basis for logic circuits, is inherently binary because it involves two states (true/false, yes/no, 1/0), making binary operations the building blocks for arithmetic, decision-making, and data manipulation in computers.
