This application is a form of our final assignment this semester for Team 7, with me, Vallerio Rayford Phoatmojo, leading the project. You can view the brainstorming part where we came up and conclude this application to be a fitting solution to a current existing problem in our [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLCZ85KQ=/?share_link_id=963205255346).

The goal of the app is to help people maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle by creating personalized schedules that focus on both work and physical activities. It starts with users providing some detailed information about themselves, like what types of exercises they prefer, their current fitness level, and what goals they have for being active—whether that’s building strength, improving endurance, or just staying consistent.

Once that’s done, users can input their current schedule, including work, personal commitments, or any other planned activities. There’s also an option to mark certain tasks or events as fixed priorities, which means these activities won’t be moved or changed when the app generates the schedule. This ensures that the most important things in the user’s life stay in place.

Using all of this input, the app creates a customized schedule that works for the user’s lifestyle, balancing their work responsibilities with the time needed for physical activity. The idea is to make the schedule as realistic and practical as possible, so it’s easier to follow.

To make things even more helpful, the app sends reminders and notifications so users can stay on track. These reminders ensure they don’t miss their important tasks or planned workouts. Overall, the app is meant to help people find a balance between productivity, physical health, and personal well-being, all in a way that fits naturally into their everyday lives.

Currently, the app is in progress and in its semi-prototyping stage. It doesn’t yet have a very pleasing UI/UX, but here are links to the GitHub repository and the Figma prototype design:
