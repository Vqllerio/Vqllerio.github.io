### About Me
Hi, I’m Vallerio Rayford Phoatmojo!
I’m an 18-year-old student at Ciputra School of Business Makassar, currently majoring in Informatics with a specialization in Fullstack Development.

I’m passionate about building innovative solutions through technology and continuously improving my technical expertise. Alongside coding, I’m also eager to hone my communication and leadership skills, as I believe they’re essential in both personal and professional growth.

When I’m not diving into code, I enjoy exploring new ways to collaborate with others, solving complex problems, and learning from diverse perspectives.

Let’s connect and create something awesome together!
